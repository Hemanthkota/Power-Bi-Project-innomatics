# Global EV Sales Analysis 

## Project Overview
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are transforming the global transportation sector due to rising fuel costs, environmental concerns, and strong government support.  
This project analyzes **global electric vehicle sales and adoption trends** across regions, vehicle types, and powertrains to understand market growth and future opportunities.

The analysis highlights how countries like **China, Europe, the USA**, and emerging markets such as **India** are contributing to the global EV ecosystem.

---

## Business Problem
How can automotive companies and policymakers understand global EV trends by:
- Region
- Vehicle type
- Powertrain
- Time period  

to make better decisions on **production planning, sales strategy, infrastructure development, and service quality**?

Lack of data-driven insights can lead to:
- Poor service quality
- Customer dissatisfaction
- Slower EV adoption
- Operational inefficiencies

---

## Types of Electric Vehicles Analyzed
- **BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle)** – Fully electric, no fuel usage  
- **PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle)** – Uses electricity and fuel  
- **HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicle)** – Fuel-based with electric assistance  
- **FCEV (Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle)** – Uses hydrogen, emits only water  

---

## Key Insights
- China contributes **over 50% of global EV value**
- **BEVs** are the fastest-growing EV category
- EV adoption accelerates significantly **after 2030**
- Developing regions show **high growth potential post-2025**
- China leads in **EV sales, stock, and charging infrastructure**
- India is emerging as a **strong future EV market**
- EV stock and EV sales are the most commonly tracked parameters

## Conclusion
The analysis confirms that global EV adoption is rapidly increasing due to:
- Environmental awareness
- Government incentives
- Advancing charging infrastructure

Electric vehicles are a key driver in the transition toward **sustainable and eco-friendly transportation** worldwide.

---

## Recommendations
- Expand public EV charging infrastructure
